This behavior isn't tied to the praying animation, nor any flags or exposed variables I could find. WalkingMonster.cooldown_timer doesn't decrement at all on the original ones, making me think there is a setting somewhere that turns off the AI entirely. The cutscene doesn't seem to track the 3 original cavemen, and instead triggers animation changes on all cavemen in the level, and kills them all when it ends. Any late spawned cavemen caught up in a cutscene animation change also get their AI disabled. However, before an animation change, the late spawns have normal AI.
