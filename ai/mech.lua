-- The mech won't shoot in mid-air, but it'll remember seeing you and shoot immediately when it lands.
-- If the mech is forced to duck while the rider wants to punch, it will shoot instead.

-- TODO: Show punch hurtbox.
-- TODO: Some riders are showing their own inactive ranges while riding, like olmites. Could add a flag to disable all ranges when riding a mount and apply it to those enemies.
