-- Tiamat cannot shoot while yelling and vice-versa. The yell is preferred if both attacks are possible at the same time.
-- Bomb yelling is triggered by having a paste bomb stuck to Tiamat's face, shoulder, or arm rest platforms, and has nothing to do with proximity. It uses the same cooldown timer as normal yells.
